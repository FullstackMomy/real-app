## Description

bizCard4U is an easy-to-use application with which you can create the ultimate business card. You can create new business cards, as well as delete and edit them as you wish. You can also add a picture and design easily and quickly.

My motivation for building the site is to strengthen the relationship between employers and people so that they can create cooperation together to promote a common goal.

I built this site because when I was looking for businesses to work with it took me a very long time, and I thought of a solution that could solve my problem and could make it easier for other people.
